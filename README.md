## Testing

### visual testing

For visual testing I had to enable an [ignore threhold](https://docs.happo.io/docs/compare-threshold)

How do we test all of the urls in our app?

What about timelineData.js, do we need to write a snapshot test for it?

- No, since the data appears in our visual tests, it's not necessary

### front-end perf

`cy.lighthouse(), Electron is not supported. Skipping...` error was a result of running Cypress on Electron. Changing to Chrome browser fixed the issue.

### updating npm packages

Use [npm-check](https://koalatea.io/how-to-update-all-your-npm-packages-at-once/)
